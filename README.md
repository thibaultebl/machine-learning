# Machine Learning from Scratch

A mini Java library implementing core machine learning algorithms from scratch.  
Currently includes:
- **Multivariate Linear Regression** (many inputs â†’ one output prediction)
- **Neural Network** with 3 layers, backpropagation, and gradient descent for training

The dataset is split into 80/20 for training and test. Features and targets are normalized for stable training.
